# Writing a TUI in BASH [WIP]

Through my travels I've discovered it's possible to write a fully functional
Terminal User Interface in BASH. The object of this guide is to document and
teach the concepts in a simple way. To my knowledge, they aren't documented
anywhere, so this is essential.

The benefit of using BASH is the lack of needed dependencies. If the system has
BASH available, the program will run. Now, there are arguments against using
BASH, and they're most of the time valid. However, there are cases where BASH is
the only thing available, and that's where this guide comes in.

This guide covers BASH `3.2+`, which encompasses pretty much every OS you'll
come across. One of the major reasons for covering this version is macOS, which
will be forever stuck with BASH `3`.

To date I have written 3 different programs using the techniques described in
this document. The best example of a TUI that covers most vital features is
[**fff**](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff) which is a Terminal File manager.

## Operating Systems

### Identify the Operating System.

The quickest way to determine the current Operating System is the `$OSTYPE`
variable. This variable is set at compile time in `bash` and typically stores
the name of the running kernel or the name of the OS itself.

You can also use the command `uname` to identify which OS is running. The
`uname` command is POSIX and should be available everywhere. The output from
`uname` does differ from `$OSTYPE` but there's a vast amount of documented
information about
it. [\[1\]](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/blob/415ef5d4aeb1cced7afcf9fd1223dd09c3306b9c/neofetch#L814-L845)
[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname)

```sh
get_os() {
    # Figure out the current operating system to handle some
    # OS specific behavior.
    # '$OSTYPE' typically stores the name of the OS kernel.
    case "$OSTYPE" in
        linux*)
            # ...
        ;;

        # Mac OS X / macOS.
        darwin*)
            # ...
        ;;

        openbsd*)
            # ...
        ;;

        # Everything else.
        *)
            #...
        ;;
    esac
}
```

### Documented `$OSTYPE` values.

The table below was populated by users submitting the value of the `$OSTYPE`
variable using the following command. If you're running an OS not mentioned
below or the output differs, please open an issue with the correct value.

```sh
bash -c "echo $OSTYPE"
```

| OS     | `$OSTYPE` |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Linux with glibc | `linux-gnu` |
| Linux with musl | `linux-musl` |
| Cygwin | `cygwin` |
| Bash on Windows 10 | `linux-gnu` |
| Msys | `msys` |
| Mingw64 | `msys` |
| Mingw32 | `msys` |
| OpenBSD | `openbsd*` |
| FreeBSD | `freebsd*` |

## Getting the window size.

### Using cursor position

This function figures out the terminal window size by moving the cursor to the
bottom right corner and then querying the terminal for the cursor's position. As
the terminal is made up of cells the bottom right corner is equal to the
terminal's size.

```sh
get_term_size() {
    # '\e7':           Save the current cursor position.
    # '\e[9999;9999H': Move the cursor to the bottom right corner.
    # '\e[6n':         Get the cursor position (window size).
    # '\e8':           Restore the cursor to its previous position.
    IFS='[;' read -sp $'\e7\e[9999;9999H\e[6n\e8' -d R -rs _ LINES COLUMNS
}
```

### Using `checkwinsize`

**Note**: This only works in `bash 4+`.

When `checkwinsize` is enabled and `bash` receives a command, the `LINES` and
`COLUMNS` variables are populated with the terminal window size. The `(:;:)`
snippet works as a pseudo command, populating the variables without running
anything external.

```sh
get_term_size() {
    shopt -s checkwinsize; (:;:)
}
```

### Using `stty`

This function calls `stty size` to query the terminal for its size. The `stty`
command is POSIX and should be available everywhere which makes it a viable
alternative to the pure `bash` solutions.

```sh
get_term_size() {
    # Get terminal size ('stty' is POSIX and always available).
    # This can't be done reliably across all bash versions in pure bash.
    read -r LINES COLUMNS < <(stty size)
}
```

## Reacting to window size changes.

Using `trap` allows us to capture and react to specific signals sent to the
running program. In this case we're trapping the `SIGWINCH` signal which is sent
to the terminal and the running shell on window resize.

We're reacting to the signal by running the above `get_term_size()`
function. The variables `$LINES` and `$COLUMNS` will be updated with the new
terminal size ready to use elsewhere in the program.

```sh
# Trap the window resize signal (handle window resize events).
# See: 'man trap' and 'trap -l'
trap 'get_term_size' WINCH
```

## Escape Sequences

For the purposes of this resource we won't be using `tput`. The `tput` command
has a lot of overhead (`10-15 ms` per invocation) and won't make the program any
more portable than sticking to standard **VT100** escape sequences. Using `tput`
also adds a dependency on `ncurses` which defeats the whole purpose of doing
this in `bash`.

### Hiding and Showing the cursor

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECTCEM.html

```sh
# Hiding the cursor.
printf '\e[?25l'

# Showing the cursor.
printf '\e[?25h'
```

### Line wrapping

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECAWM.html

```sh
# Disabling line wrapping.
printf '\e[?7l'

# Enabling line wrapping.
printf '\e[?7h'
```

### Moving the cursor to specific coordinates

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUP.html

```sh
# Move the cursor to 0,0.
printf '\e[H'

# Move the cursor to line 3, column 10.
printf '\e[3;10H'

# Move the cursor to line 5.
printf '\e[5H'
```

### Moving the cursor to the bottom of the terminal.

See:

- [getting-the-window-size](#getting-the-window-size)
- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUP.html

```sh
# Using terminal size, move cursor to bottom.
printf '\e[%sH' "$LINES"
```

### Moving the cursor relatively

When using these escape sequences and the cursor hits the edge of the window it
stops.

#### Cursor Up

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUU.html

```sh
# Move the cursor up a line.
printf '\e[A'

# Move the cursor up 10 lines.
printf '\e[10A'
```

#### Cursor Down

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUD.html

```sh
# Move the cursor down a line.
printf '\e[B'

# Move the cursor down 10 lines.
printf '\e[10B'
```

#### Cursor Left

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUB.html

```sh
# Move the cursor back a column.
printf '\e[D'

# Move the cursor back 10 columns.
printf '\e[10D'
```

#### Cursor Right

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUF.html

```sh
# Move the cursor forward a column.
printf '\e[C'

# Move the cursor forward 10 columns.
printf '\e[10C'
```

### Clearing the screen

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/ED.html
- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUP.html

```sh
# Clear the screen.
printf '\e[2J'

# Clear the screen and move cursor to (0,0).
# This mimics the 'clear' command.
printf '\e[2J\e[H'
```

### Setting the scroll area.

This sequence allow you to limit the terminal's vertical scrolling area between
two points. This comes in handy when you need to reserve portions of the screen
for a top or bottom status-line (*you don't want them to scroll*).

This sequence also has the side-effect of moving the cursor to the top-left of
the boundaries. This means you can use it directly after a screen clear instead
of `\e[H` (`\e[2J\e[0;10r`).

See:

- https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECSTBM.html

```sh
# Limit scrolling from line 0 to line 10.
printf '\e[0;10r'

# Set scrolling margins back to default.
printf '\e[;r'
```

### Saving and Restoring the user's terminal screen.

This is the only non **VT100** sequences I'll be covering. This sequence allows
you to save and restore the user's terminal screen when running your
program. When the user exits the program, their command-line will be restored as
it was before running the program.

While this sequence is XTerm specific, it is covered by almost all modern
terminal emulators and simply ignored in older ones. There is also
[DECCRA](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECCRA.html) which may or may not be
more widely supported than the XTerm sequence but I haven't done much testing.

```sh
# Save the user's terminal screen.
printf '\e[?1049h'

# Restore the user's terminal screen.
printf '\e[?1049l'
```
